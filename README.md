## qCanvas : Javascript canvas wrapper library

A wrapper for HTML5 Canvas 2D Context properties and methods. It's intended to be simple, small and it doesn't overwrite the native prototypes/objects and can be used interchangeably with native Context2D methods/properties, works just as a wrapper to native calls. For use/ syntax see the included demos.
